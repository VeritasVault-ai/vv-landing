/**
 * TEMPORARY FILE - PART OF CODEBASE MIGRATION
 * 
 * This is a temporary re-export file created to fix a path mismatch.
 * It redirects imports from the singular 'websocket-simulation' to the 
 * correct plural path 'websocket-simulations'.
 * 
 * TODO: Once all imports have been updated to use the correct path directly,
 * this file should be deleted and imports should point to:
 * '@/lib/services/websocket-simulations'
