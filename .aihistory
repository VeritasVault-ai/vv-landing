# AI History for VeritasVault.ai

## Historical Record

### [2025-05-12] Dashboard Architecture Improvements

**Context:** The dashboard needed architectural improvements for better maintainability, performance, and security

**Decision/Finding:** Implemented a comprehensive service layer, error handling system, performance optimizations, and accessibility improvements

**Rationale:** The previous implementation lacked consistent patterns, had potential security vulnerabilities, and needed performance enhancements for handling large datasets

**Implications:** The new architecture provides better separation of concerns, improved error handling, and enhanced security practices

**Related Components:** 
- Service layer (`lib/services/`)
- Error boundaries (`components/error-boundary-secure.tsx`)
- Data fetching hooks (`hooks/use-async-data-secure.ts`)
- Virtualized components (`components/ui/virtualized-table-secure.tsx`)

### [2025-05-12] AI Feature Implementation

**Context:** Need for transparent and ethical AI integration in the dashboard

**Decision/Finding:** Created a comprehensive AI integration framework with transparency indicators, user controls, and history tracking

**Rationale:** AI features should be implemented with transparency, user control, and proper data handling to maintain trust and comply with best practices

**Implications:** All AI-powered features will clearly indicate AI involvement, provide confidence levels, collect user feedback, and allow users to control AI settings

**Related Components:**
- AI History Tracker (`lib/ai/ai-history-tracker.ts`)
- AI Settings Provider (`components/ai/ai-settings-provider.tsx`)
- AI Transparency Components:
  - AI Badge (`components/ai/ai-badge.tsx`)
  - AI Confidence Indicator (`components/ai/ai-confidence-indicator.tsx`)
  - AI Feedback (`components/ai/ai-feedback.tsx`)
- AI Settings Controls:
  - Main Settings Dialog (`components/ai/ai-settings-control.tsx`)
  - Settings Sections (General, Features, Privacy, Display, Personalization)

### [2025-05-12] Security Enhancement Implementation

**Context:** Security vulnerabilities identified in environment variable handling and data processing

**Decision/Finding:** Implemented secure practices for environment variables, data sanitization, and error handling

**Rationale:** Proper security practices are essential to protect sensitive data and prevent information leakage

**Implications:** Enhanced security across the application with particular focus on preventing credential leakage and sanitizing sensitive information

**Related Components:**
- Environment validation (`lib/env-validation.ts`)
- Secure service base (`lib/services/base-service-secure.ts`)
- Secure error handling (`components/error-boundary-secure.tsx`)
- Data sanitization utilities (throughout codebase)

## Implementation Plan

The dashboard improvements are being implemented according to a phased approach:

1. **Service Layer Migration**: Creating a consistent pattern for API interactions
2. **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error boundaries and recovery strategies
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Adding virtualization and memoization for improved performance
4. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensuring WCAG compliance and proper screen reader support
5. **AI Integration**: Implementing transparent and ethical AI features
