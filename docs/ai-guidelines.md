# AI Usage Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for integrating and using AI capabilities within the VeritasVault dashboard.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency
- Users must always be informed when interacting with AI-generated content or AI-powered features
- Clear indicators should distinguish AI-generated content from human-created content
- The limitations of AI systems should be clearly communicated

### 2. User Control
- Users must have the ability to opt out of AI features
- Critical decisions should always require human confirmation
- Users should be able to provide feedback on AI outputs

### 3. Privacy & Security
- AI systems should process only the minimum data necessary to perform their function
- Personal data used for AI training or inference must be properly anonymized
- All AI interactions should be logged for audit purposes

### 4. Accuracy & Quality
- AI-generated content should be regularly evaluated for accuracy
- Known limitations should be documented and mitigated
- Continuous improvement processes should be established

### 5. Fairness & Bias Mitigation
- AI systems should be regularly audited for bias
- Diverse training data should be used to minimize unfair outcomes
- Feedback mechanisms should be in place to identify and address bias

## Implementation Requirements

### UI Components

All AI-powered features must include:

1. **AI Indicator**: Visual indicator showing when content is AI-generated
   ```tsx
   <AIBadge type="generated" />
   ```

2. **Confidence Level**: When appropriate, display the AI's confidence in its output
   ```tsx
   <AIConfidenceIndicator level={0.92} />
   ```

3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to report issues with AI outputs
   ```tsx
   <AIFeedback contentId="ai-output-123" />
   ```

4. **Opt-Out Option**: Provide a way for users to disable AI features
   ```tsx
   <AISettingsControl defaultEnabled={true} />
   ```

### Data Handling

1. **Minimization**: Only collect and process data necessary for the AI feature
2. **Anonymization**: Remove personally identifiable information before processing
3. **Retention**: Establish clear data retention policies for AI training data
4. **Consent**: Obtain explicit consent before using user data for AI training

### Logging & Monitoring

1. **Usage Logging**: Record all AI feature usage for audit purposes
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track accuracy and performance metrics
3. **Feedback Analysis**: Regularly review user feedback on AI outputs
4. **Incident Response**: Establish procedures for addressing AI-related issues

## Feature-Specific Guidelines

### AI-Powered Recommendations

- Clearly label recommendations as AI-generated
- Provide explanation for why items were recommended
- Include diverse recommendations to avoid filter bubbles
- Allow users to adjust recommendation parameters

### Predictive Analytics

- Communicate confidence intervals for predictions
- Explain key factors influencing predictions
- Provide historical accuracy rates for context
- Allow users to see alternative scenarios

### Content Generation

- Always indicate when content is AI-generated
- Provide editing tools for users to modify generated content
- Include disclaimers about potential inaccuracies
- Implement human review for critical content

## Compliance & Ethics

- Regular ethical reviews of AI implementations
- Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Documentation of AI model development and training
- Impact assessments for high-risk AI applications

## Review Process

These guidelines should be reviewed quarterly to ensure they remain current with technological developments and best practices in AI ethics and governance.
