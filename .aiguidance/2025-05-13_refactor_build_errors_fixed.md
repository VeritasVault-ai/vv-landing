# Build Errors Fixed with Temporary Bridge Files

## Overview

This document tracks the build errors that were fixed by creating temporary bridge files during the migration to the src/ directory structure.

## Context

During the build process, several import errors were encountered due to the ongoing migration to the src/ directory structure. These errors needed to be addressed immediately to maintain a working build while continuing the migration.

## Decisions/Findings

We created temporary bridge files that redirect imports from their old locations to the new locations in the src/ directory. This approach allows us to fix build errors immediately while maintaining a clear path toward cleaning up these temporary files once all imports are updated.

## Implementation Details

The following bridge files were created to fix specific build errors:

1. **components/theme-provider.tsx**
   - Error: `Can't resolve '@/components/theme-provider'`
   - Solution: Created bridge file that re-exports from `@/src/lib/context/ThemeProvider`
   - Used in: `app/auth/layout.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`

2. **lib/context/theme-context.tsx**
   - Error: `Can't resolve '@/lib/context/theme-context'`
   - Solution: Created bridge file that re-exports from `@/src/lib/context/ThemeProvider`
   - Used in: `app/corporate-version/dashboard/layout.tsx`

3. **components/layout/header.tsx**
   - Error: `Can't resolve '@/components/layout/header'`
   - Solution: Created bridge file that re-exports from `@/src/components/layout/VersionAwareHeader`, `StandardHeader`, and `CorporateHeader`
   - Used in: `app/standard-version/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/standard-version/marketing/page.tsx`

Each bridge file follows the same pattern:
- Clear documentation indicating it's a temporary part of the migration
- Information about where imports should point to after cleanup
- Re-exports of the components from their new locations

## Implications

- The build now completes successfully
- We've maintained backward compatibility with existing import paths
- We've created a clear path toward cleaning up these temporary files
- We've documented the changes for future reference

## Next Steps

1. Update imports throughout the codebase to use the new src/ paths directly
2. Once all imports are updated, remove the temporary bridge files
3. Continue monitoring the build for any additional import errors
