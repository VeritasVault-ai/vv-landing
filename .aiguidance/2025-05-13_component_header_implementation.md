# StandardHeader Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the StandardHeader component with scroll effects and gradient text styling.

## Context

The landing page header needed to be updated with scroll effects and gradient text to improve visual appeal and user experience. The SimpleHeader component was redundant and could be removed.

## Decisions/Findings

1. Enhanced the StandardHeader component with scroll effects that respond to the user's scroll position
2. Added gradient text styling for the header title
3. Deleted the SimpleHeader component as it was unused and redundant
4. Kept DynamicLandingPage and StandardLandingPageScreenshotMatch components for reference

## Rationale

These changes improve the visual appeal of the landing page while reducing code duplication. The scroll effects create a more dynamic and engaging user experience, and the gradient text adds visual interest to the header title.

## Implementation Details

### Scroll Effect Implementation

The scroll effect uses the following approach:
- Track scroll position with a React hook
- Apply CSS transformations based on scroll position
- Use opacity transitions for fade effects
- Ensure smooth performance with throttling or requestAnimationFrame

### Gradient Text Implementation

The gradient text styling uses CSS background gradients with text-fill-color:
```css
.gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #3A86FF, #4ECDC4);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
```

## Related Components

- src/components/StandardHeader.tsx (updated)
- components/SimpleHeader.tsx (deleted)
- components/DynamicLandingPage.tsx (kept for reference)
- components/StandardLandingPageScreenshotMatch.tsx (kept for reference)

## Next Steps

1. Consider applying similar scroll effects to other components for consistency
2. Evaluate whether DynamicLandingPage and StandardLandingPageScreenshotMatch should be updated or removed
3. Update any imports that might still reference SimpleHeader
