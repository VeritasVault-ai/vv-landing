# Dashboard Context Implementation Fix

## Overview

This document describes the fix for the missing dashboard context modules that were causing build errors during the migration to the src/ directory structure.

## Context

During the build process, we encountered errors related to missing dashboard context modules. Specifically, the error was:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './dashboard-context'
```

This occurred because the dashboard context implementation was being referenced from multiple locations but was not properly implemented in the new directory structure.

## Root Cause Analysis

The specific issues were:

1. The `contexts/dashboard/index.ts` file was trying to import `useDashboard` from `./dashboard-context`, but that file didn't exist in the `contexts/dashboard` directory.

2. The `contexts/dashboard/dashboard-provider.tsx` file was trying to import `DashboardContext` from `./dashboard-context`, which also didn't exist.

3. Components were referencing `contexts/dashboard-context-improved.tsx`, which was not properly implemented as a bridge file.

## Solution Implemented

We created a comprehensive set of bridge files and implemented the new dashboard context structure in the src/ directory:

### Bridge Files Created:

1. **contexts/dashboard/dashboard-context.ts**:
   - Created a bridge file that exports the `DashboardContext` and `useDashboard` hook
   - Provided default values for the context to avoid type errors

2. **contexts/dashboard-context-improved.tsx**:
   - Created a bridge file that re-exports from the new implementation in src/contexts/dashboard
   - Ensured all necessary types and hooks are properly exported

### New Implementation in src/ Directory:

1. **src/contexts/dashboard/index.ts**:
   - Central export point for the dashboard context module

2. **src/contexts/dashboard/types.ts**:
   - Comprehensive type definitions for the dashboard context

3. **src/contexts/dashboard/DashboardContext.tsx**:
   - Context definition with default values

4. **src/contexts/dashboard/useDashboard.tsx**:
   - Hook to access the dashboard context

5. **src/contexts/dashboard/DashboardProvider.tsx**:
   - Provider component with state management and data fetching

6. **src/contexts/dashboard/useDashboardWithTheme.tsx**:
   - Utility hook that combines dashboard and theme contexts

## Implementation Details

### Bridge File Pattern

Each bridge file follows the same pattern:
- Clear documentation indicating it's a temporary part of the migration
- Information about where imports should point to after cleanup
- Re-exports of the components from their new locations

### New Implementation Pattern

The new implementation in src/contexts/dashboard follows a modular pattern:
- Separate files for different concerns (context, provider, hooks, types)
- Clear naming conventions (DashboardContext, DashboardProvider)
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Mock service implementation for development

## Implications

- The build now completes successfully without the dashboard context errors
- We've maintained backward compatibility with existing import paths
- We've created a clear path toward cleaning up these temporary files
- We've established a pattern for implementing context modules in the src/ directory

## Next Steps

1. Update imports throughout the codebase to use the new src/ paths directly
2. Once all imports are updated, remove the temporary bridge files
3. Continue monitoring the build for any additional import errors
4. Consider applying this modular context pattern to other context implementations
