# AI Guidance Documentation

This directory contains AI guidance documents for the VeritasVault.ai project. These documents serve as a knowledge base for AI assistants working on the codebase, providing context, decisions, and insights to maintain continuity across different AI sessions.

## File Structure

Files in this directory follow this naming convention:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_category_topic.md`: Date-prefixed files for specific topics
- `index.md`: Overview of all AI guidance documents
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the purpose and structure

## Categories

- `refactor`: Refactoring decisions and strategies
- `component`: Component-specific guidance and decisions
- `architecture`: Architectural decisions and patterns
- `strategy`: Overall project strategies and approaches
- `issue`: Documentation of specific issues and their solutions

## How to Use

AI assistants should:

1. Review relevant guidance documents before making significant changes
2. Update existing documents when new information is discovered
3. Create new documents for major decisions or findings
4. Cross-reference between documents when appropriate
