# AI History for VeritasVault.net

## Overview

This document serves as a historical record of important AI-related decisions, findings, and insights for the VeritasVault.net platform. All AI assistants working on this codebase should document significant discoveries or decisions here to maintain continuity and knowledge sharing between different AI sessions.

## Purpose

- Provide context for future AI assistants working on the codebase
- Document architectural decisions and their rationales
- Track evolution of AI features and implementation approaches
- Highlight important findings about the codebase structure and patterns
- Preserve institutional knowledge across different AI sessions

## Guidelines for AI Documentation

When working with this repository, AI assistants should:

1. **Document Important Decisions**:
   - Record any significant architectural or design decisions made
   - Explain the reasoning behind these decisions
   - Note alternative approaches that were considered but rejected

2. **Record Key Findings**:
   - Document important discoveries about the codebase structure
   - Note patterns, conventions, and architectural approaches used
   - Highlight any non-obvious relationships between components

3. **Track Implementation Challenges**:
   - Document challenges encountered during implementation
   - Record solutions or workarounds developed
   - Note any performance considerations discovered

4. **Maintain Knowledge Continuity**:
   - Reference previous entries when building upon earlier work
   - Update outdated information when new approaches are implemented
   - Ensure documentation remains coherent as the codebase evolves

## Documentation Format

When adding entries to this document, follow this format:

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief Title of Finding or Decision

**Context:** Brief description of the situation or problem being addressed

**Decision/Finding:** Clear statement of what was decided or discovered

**Rationale:** Explanation of why this decision was made or why the finding is significant

**Implications:** How this affects the codebase, development process, or user experience

**Related Components:** List of files or components most affected by this information
```
